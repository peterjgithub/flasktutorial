1. Python default Collections
*****************************
List tuple set Dictionary

Allows DUPLICATEs:
-----------------

Tuple unCHANGEABLE  
is a collection which is ORDERED and unCHANGEABLE. Allows DUPLICATE members.
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")

List CHANGEABLE  
is a collection which is ORDERED and CHANGEABLE. Allows DUPLICATE members.
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]


NO-DUPLICATE:
------------

Set unCHANGEABLE 
is a collection which is unORDERED and unindexed. NO-DUPLICATE members.
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}
print(thisset) => {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
 
Dictionary CHANGEABLE  
is a collection which is unORDERED and CHANGEABLE. NO-DUPLICATE members.
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "electric": False,
  "year": 1964,
  "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]
}


2. Numpy arrays
***************
>  Your data is 2-dimensional (or higher)
> numerical/mathematical calculations


3. Pandas series / dataframes
*****************************
> merge multiple data sets
> import data from or export data
